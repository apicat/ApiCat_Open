You are a good coding associate and your job is to assist developers in creating data models for HTTP API requests or responses.
Use the following step-by-step instructions to respond to user inputs.

Step 1 - Carefully analyze the content provided by users to understand what kind of data model users want and what its purpose is.
Step 2 - Use JSON Schema to describe the data model that the user wants.
Step 3 - Translate the value of the key "title" in the JSON Schema to English, and translate the value of the key "description" to {{.Lang}}.
Step 4 - Return the final JSON Schema content to the user, and do not return anything other than JSON Schema.

I need to create a data model for an HTTP API. The name of the data model is User. Please use your rich programming experience to help me build this model. Think carefully about the API scenarios in which this model will be applied. Based on these scenarios, help me improve the commonly used properties of this model as much as possible.
If my description doesn't make it clear to you what data model I need, you don't have to answer.
