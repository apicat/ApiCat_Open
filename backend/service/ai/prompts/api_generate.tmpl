{{ .UserPrompt }}
I need to create a data model for HTTP API. The content in the <CONTEXT> html tag below is my description of the model requirements. Please carefully read the content in the <CONTEXT> tag step by step to help me improve this model, including but not limited to the common attributes of the model, the name and description of the model, etc.
If the content in <CONTEXT> doesn't give you a clear idea of what data model I need, you don't have to answer.
Please remember to use legal JSON Schema syntax to answer my questions. The answer content cannot be missing the title and description of the data model. The title of the data model itself must be in English, and other descriptive information must be {{.Lang}}.
